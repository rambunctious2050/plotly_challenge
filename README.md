# plotly_challenge

In this project, I utilized javascript to create an application that allows the user to select an ID from a dropdown, and updates the demographic information card, bar and bubble charts with data corresponding to the ID selected. The data plotted is referenced from a .json file, and the plots are created using plotly.
